Visualizes DJI SRT logs

Try it live here: http://djitelemetryoverlay.com

Uses P5js (https://p5js.org/) in Instance mode (https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode) and the following NPM modules

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/dji_srt_parser
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/latlon_to_xy
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5_gui
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/mapbox_static_helper

Can be built with Browserify (https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify) and Babelify (https://www.npmjs.com/package/babelify)

Discussion and suggestions here: https://forum.dji.com/thread-140031-1-1.html

## Build

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

If ES6 is not a problem, a different approach is to use Browserify (or Watchify) from the command line:

```shell
$ browserify sketch.js -o bundle.js
```

## TODO

- Review why the H sign appears with bad data (some gopro samples in gpx)
- Read and save remote gpx in local storage?
- satellite images appear pixelated now, for some reason
- different playing speeds?
- Move sidebar to bottom if proportion is... Worse than square? Height still in side. Load on top? smooth vertical? Camera and location divided in lines. background and downloads divided. speeds horizontal?
- drop load files?
- move createGUI to visual_setup module?
